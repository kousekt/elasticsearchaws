ElasticSearch example running on .NET Core 1.1 in AWS (this should also work on .NET Core 2.0 too)

This is an update to the app found here https://github.com/kousekt/ElasticSearchNetCore11 to include AWS functionality + elastic search

A very handy blog post showing the Fluent API for ElasticSearch with examples
